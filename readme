Installation of Linux on a Zotac Zbox PI321 (with 32 bit UEFI)

Create a bootable USB drive with a 64 bit Linux

Copy the file bootia32.efi from github https://github.com/hirotakaster/baytail-bootia32.efi  into the folder "EFI/boot" of said USB drive

Connect the drive to the Mini-PC and start it up

Go into the UEFI, disable "Secure Boot" and "Fast Boot", save, exit and restart

Boot from the USB drive and select "Try Ubuntu without installing"

Disable the screen saver, because the PC is not able to wake up from it

Use GParted to resize the existing Windows partition in order to free up space for Linux (I completely deleted it because I don't want to use Windows at all anymore)

Install Linux to the internal eMMC

After the installation don't restart, but connect a network cable to the PC, open a terminal and enter these commands:


sudo -s

mount /dev/mmcblk0p5 /mnt

mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/boot/efi

for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done

mount -o bind /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf

chroot /mnt /bin/bash

apt-get update

apt-get -y remove grub-efi-amd64

apt-get -y install grub-efi-ia32

sed -i 's/vmlinuz-3.16.0-23-generic.efi.signed/vmlinuz-3.16.0-23-generic/g' /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Then restart the PC and Linux should be able to be booted

Almost all of these steps worked perfectly fine for me (I had to change the names of the two partitions to the ones in my PC of course, and the number of the kernel in the last line to the one that was shown by "uname -r"), up until here:

apt-get -y remove grub-efi-amd64

Here are the lines following it:

root@mint:/# apt-get -y remove grub-efi-amd64

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have

requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable

distribution that some required packages have not yet been created

or been moved out of Incoming.

The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:

shim-signed : Depends: grub-efi-amd64-signed but it is not going to be installed or

grub-efi-arm64-signed but it is not installable

E: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.

root@mint:/# sed -i 's/vmlinuz-5.15.0-56-generic.efi.signed/vmlinuz-5.15.0-56-generic/g' /boot/grub/grub.cfg

root@mint:/#

After restarting, I simply end up in the EFI shell, and I don't know how to proceed from here
